                <h1>Why This Website</h1>
                <P>This Scholarship Hub Website will link students who qualified to graduate from highschool with excellent grades and haven't got a chance to join higher learning institutions.
                Scholarships provide an opportunity for people to earn an education. 
                Lack of assistance from an outside source may lead to students having trouble paying for the degree. 
                Scholarships help students have more time to focus on their studies as well as a boost to morale and a student's confidence in their ability to work toward a better future.
                </P>
